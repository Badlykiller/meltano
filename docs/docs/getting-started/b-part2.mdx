In this tutorial, we will replicate this pipeline for multiple customers with different credentials, and save the data into S3.

This part covers replicating the pipeline programmatically.


## A customer list
Take the following content and store it as `customer_configs.csv` next to your `meltano.yml` file:

```
id,repository,auth_token
1,sbalnojan/lightdash,ghp_XXY
2,DouweM/tidbyt-guess-the-flag,ghp_XXZ
3,sbalnojan/functional-data-engineering,ghp_XXS
4,DouweM/tidbyt-homebridge-unifi,ghp_XXB
```

Also store a template `.env` files as this:

```
TAP_GITHUB_AUTH_TOKEN=[SUBSTITUE_AUTH_TOKEN]
TAP_GITHUB_REPOSITORIES=[SUBSTITUTE_REPOSITORIES]
```

## Use a bash script to create .env files on the fly...

## Make the meltano.yml more configurable

Just delete the repositories line, then they will be loaded on the fly!

```yml
  plugins:
    extractors:
    - name: tap-github
      config:
        start_date: '2022-01-01'
      select:
      - commits.url
      - commits.sha
      - commits.commit_timestamp
```

## Run it once

...

## Add some trigger
<p>
```export CUST_ID=1; ````
</p>
 meltano picks up everything from here on...
