import Termy from '@site/src/utils/Termy'

Let’s learn by example.

Throughout this tutorial, we’ll walk you through one of many applications of Meltano. All of them are about:
- connecting to data
- processing it
- and finally storing it in some permanent storage or pushing it to another component

In this part, we're going to start with connecting to data.

We're going to take data from a "source", namely GitHub, and extract a list of commits to one repository.

To test that this part works, we will dump the data into JSON files.
In Part 2, we will then place this data into a PostgreSQL database.

We'll ssume you have [Meltano installed](/getting-started/installation) already. You can tell Meltano is installed and which version by running ` meltano version`

<Termy>

```console
$ meltano --version
meltano, version 2.19.0
```

</Termy>

<br />

This tutorial is written using meltano >= v2.0.0.

If you don't have a GitHub account to follow along, you could either exchange the commands for a different tap, like GitLab or PostgreSQL, or you can create a free GitHub account. You will also need a [personal access token to your GitHub account](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token).

## Create Your Meltano Project

Step 1 is to create a new [Meltano project](/concepts/project) that (among other things)
will hold the [plugins](/concepts/plugins) that implement the details of our pipeline.

1. Navigate to the directory that you'd like to hold your Meltano projects.

2. Initialize a new project in a directory of your choosing using [`meltano init`](/reference/command-line-interface#init):

```bash
meltano init my-meltano-project
```

<br />

<Termy>

```console
$ meltano init my-new-project
Created my-new-project
Creating project files...
  my-new-project/
  |-- .meltano
  |-- meltano.yml
  |-- README.md
  |-- requirements.txt
  |-- output/.gitignore
  |-- .gitignore
  |-- extract/.gitkeep
  |-- load/.gitkeep
  |-- transform/.gitkeep
  |-- analyze/.gitkeep
  |-- notebook/.gitkeep
  |-- orchestrate/.gitkeep
Creating system database...  Done!
... Project my-new-project has been created!

Meltano Environments initialized with dev, staging, and prod.
To learn more about Environments visit: https://docs.meltano.com/concepts/environments

Next steps:
  cd my-new-project
  Visit https://docs.meltano.com/getting-started#create-your-meltano-project to learn where to go from here.
```

</Termy>

<br />

This action will create a new directory with, among other things, your [`meltano.yml` project file](/concepts/project#meltano-yml-project-file). Your file will look something like this:

```yml
version: 1
default_environment: dev
project_id: <unique-GUID>
environments:
- name: dev
- name: staging
- name: prod
```

1. Navigate to the newly created project directory:

```bash
cd my-meltano-project
```

## Add an Extractor to Pull Data from a Source

Now that you have your very own Meltano project, it's time to add [plugins](/concepts/plugins) to it. We're going to add an extrator for GitHub to get our data. An [extractor](/concepts/plugins#extractors) is responsible for pulling data out of any data source. In this case, we choose a specific one with the `--variant` option to make this tutorial easy to work with.

1.  Add the GitHub extractor

```bash
meltano add extractor tap-github --variant=meltanolabs
```

<br />

<Termy>

```console
$ meltano add extractor tap-github --variant=meltanolabs
2022-09-19T09:32:05.162591Z [info     ] Environment 'dev' is active
Added extractor 'tap-github' to your Meltano project
Variant:        meltanolabs (default)
Repository:     https://github.com/meltanolabs/tap-github
Documentation:  https://hub.meltano.com/extractors/tap-github

Installing extractor 'tap-github'...
Installed extractor 'tap-github'

To learn more about extractor 'tap-github', visit https://hub.meltano.com/extractors/tap-github
```

</Termy>

<br />

This will add the new plugin to your [`meltano.yml` project file](/concepts/project#plugins):

```yml
plugins:
extractors:
  - name: tap-github
    variant: meltanolabs
    pip_url: git+https://github.com/MeltanoLabs/tap-github.git
```

1.  Test that the installation was successful by calling [`meltano invoke`](/reference/command-line-interface#invoke):

```bash
$ meltano invoke tap-github --help
```

<br />

If you see the extractor's help message printed, the plugin was definitely installed successfully.

<Termy>

```console
$ meltano invoke tap-github --help
2022-09-19T09:32:05.162591Z [info     ] Environment 'dev' is active
Usage: tap-github [OPTIONS]

  Execute the Singer tap.

Options:
  --state PATH              Use a bookmarks file for incremental replication.
  --catalog PATH            Use a Singer catalog file with the tap.
  --test TEXT               Use --test to sync a single record for each
                            stream. Use --test=schema to test schema output
                            without syncing records.
  --discover                Run the tap in discovery mode.
  --config TEXT             Configuration file location or 'ENV' to use
                            environment variables.
  --format [json|markdown]  Specify output style for --about
  --about                   Display package metadata and settings.
  --version                 Display the package version.
  --help                    Show this message and exit.
```

</Termy>

### Configure the Extractor

The GitHub tap requires [configuration](/guide/configuration) before it can start extracting data.

Paste the following config into the plugins section of your [`meltano.yml` project file](/concepts/project#plugin-configuration) file:

```yml
  plugins:
    extractors:
    - name: tap-github
      config:
        start_date: '2022-01-01'
        repositories:
        - TODO_PUT_YOUR_REPOSITORY_HERE #example: sbalnojan/meltano-lightdash
      select:
      - commits.url
      - commits.sha
      - commits.commit_timestamp
```
Replace TODO_PUT_YOUR_REPOSITORY_HERE with a repository you have acccess rights to.. Then create a github auth token (on github.com) and add it to your
 `.env` file in the following way:

```yml
TAP_GITHUB_AUTH_TOKEN='ghp_XXX' # YOUR TOKEN!!!
```

And now, let's run our tap!

```bash
meltano invoke tap-github
```

<br />

<Termy>

```console
$ meltano invoke tap-github
2...
```

</Termy>

Let's dive into what we just did


## Configuring a connector
You can always check that a connector is configured correctly by running:

```bash
meltano config tap-github
```

<br />

<Termy>

```console
$ meltano config tap-github
2022-09-19T11:26:22.888257Z [info     ] Environment 'dev' is active
2022-09-19T11:26:23.573556Z [info     ] The default environment (dev) will be ignored for `meltano config`. To configure a specific Environment, please use option `--environment=[]`.

{
  "auth_token": "ghp_XXX",
  "repositories": [
  &ensp;&ensp;"sbalnojan/meltano-lightdash"
  ],
  "start_date": "2022-01-01"
}
```

</Termy>

That's very useful for checking for YAML indention issues!

## Working with env variables
The variable `TAP_GITHUB_AUTH_TOKEN=` automatically is loaded into Meltano. Alternatively you could configure the "auth_token" attribute of the connector, b
with environment variables you're always on the safe side for credentials and the likes.


## Select Entities and Attributes to Extract
This piece of the code
```
      select:
      - commits.url
      - commits.sha
      - commits.commit_timestamp
```

tell the tap what specific pieces of data you want from this one GitHub repository.

To figure out what data attributes are available, you can use the Meltano CLI:

```bash
meltano select tap-github --list --all
```

<br />

<Termy>

```console
$ meltano select tap-github --list
2023-05-17T20:07:24.085827Z [info     ] The default environment 'dev' will be ignored for 'meltano select'. To configure a specific environment, please use the option '--environment=environment name'.

```

</Termy>


## Time to decide! What do you want to build?

Installing and connecting data, all data integration engine use cases have that in common, but now you have to decide what you want to try out:

1. Do you want to [save this data into memory (via duckDB) and then run a Python script to transform it?](/getting-started/a-part2).
2. Do you want to [replicate this pipeline for 10 customers with different credentials, and save the data into S3?](/getting-started/b-part2)
3. Do you want to [load it as CSV into a Jupyter Notebook, run an ML algorithm over it and turn this into a complete pipeline?](/getting-started/b-part2)
4. Do you want to [load this data into a data warehouse (postgres) and then use dbt to transform it?](/getting-started/d-part2).

Go for it...
